### What I Find Interesting:
I really enjoy that this article is not only humorous, but easy to understand from both a technical and non-technical perspective. The article also hints at a really *important* aspect of Machine Learning: how failures are really interesting and important to understanding how the machine is learning and how it can be improved upon. Often times, especially as students in or coming from an academic environment, we get stuck in trying to perfect code and always get the right answer. While this is of course always what we should strive for, I think there is a certain need for encouraging understanding of our failures and our program failures, especially in something as challenging and incrememtal as machine learning. This article frames the discussion in a humorous and relatively inconsequential way that allows us to see how funny and beautiful mistakes in machine learning can be.
